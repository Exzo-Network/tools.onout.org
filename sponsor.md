We have 3 ways how to sponsor development:

## 1. Feature sponsorship: 
If you are a user of the product and want to add an improvement. Improvements costs is calculated by a developer. To request a feature please email support@onout.org or https://t.me/onoutsupportbot/?start=feature_sponsor. Describe your needs (what to be done) then a developer will answer you price and ETA. We do not do customization, we only work to features that will be in demand by other users.

## 2. Project sponsorthip:
You credit us for X$ and we pay you back X$*1.5, but from future profit of this product (for example 10% of revenue will be used to repay). 
And of course, you will get a forever license, primary support, installation service etc. 

Usecase: After research we desided to create a DAO tool, development costs is 4000$ and 2 month. The tool was released at early 2022. The product becomes profitable in 3 month.  (Revenue: Jan 1400$, Feb 1670$, March 2000$). If you were a sponsor you would get 170 bucks every month or 50%APY. Sales of another our product MCW only grows for almost 2 yeasrs that's mean real APY would be higher. But there are also risks of small sales or of stucked develop.
