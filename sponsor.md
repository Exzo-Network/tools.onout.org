We have 3 ways how to sponsor development:

## 1. Feature sponsorship: 
If you are a user of the product and want to add an improvement. Improvement costs is calculated by a developer. To request a feature, please email support@onout.org or https://t.me/onoutsupportbot/?start=feature_sponsor. Describe your needs (what to be done) then a developer will answer you price and ETA. We do not do customization, we only work to features that will be in demand by other users.

## 2. Project sponsorship:
You credit us for X$ and we pay you back X$*1.5, but from future profit of this product (for example, 10% of revenue will be used to repay). 
And of course, you will get a forever license, primary support, installation service etc. 

Use case: After research we decided to create a DAO tool, development costs is $4000 and 2 months. The tool was released in the beginning of 2022. The product becomes profitable in 3 months.  (Revenue: Jan $1400, Feb $1670, March $2000). If you were a sponsor, you would get 170 bucks every month or 50%APY. Sales of another product MCW only grows for almost 2 years, that's mean real APY would be higher. But there are also risks of small sales or of delay. 

Q: How exactly a sponsor will take a profit? <Br>
A: We add your address directly to the contract that receives payments for products. Part of the amount of each purchase is immediately sends directly to your wallet.

Q: How to start? <Br>
A: At first check our "presale" tab on dash.onout.org. If you know which project to fork collect this information:

- example links.
- is this project is opensource?
- source code license type. The best license types are MIT or GNU.

Please contact us and send this info to support@onout.org or [Telegram](https://t.me/onoutsupportbot/?start=feature_sponsor)

## 3. Buying new product on presale
In case when we have ETA of new product, we're added it to the dash.onnout.org, and you can find it in the "presale" tab. Presale price is always lower than after release.
